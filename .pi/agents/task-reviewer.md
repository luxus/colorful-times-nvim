  Project-Specific Reviewer Guidance

  This file is COMPOSED with the base task-reviewer prompt shipped in the
  taskplane package. Your content here is appended after the base prompt.

  The base prompt (maintained by taskplane) handles:
  - Plan review and code review workflows
  - Verdict format (APPROVE / REVISE)
  - Review file output conventions
  - Plan granularity guidance
  - Persistent reviewer mode (wait_for_review registered tool workflow — NOT bash)

  Add project-specific review criteria below. Common examples:
  - Required test coverage thresholds
  - Security review checklist items
  - Architecture constraints to enforce
  - Performance requirements

  To override frontmatter values (tools, model), uncomment and edit above.
  To use this file as a FULLY STANDALONE prompt (ignoring the base),
  uncomment `standalone: true` above and write the complete prompt below.
